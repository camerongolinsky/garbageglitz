              discovered a half-eaten pizza in a dumpster outside a childâ€™s
              birthday party in 2018. Feeling delighted with the feast, Mr.
              LaCoon devoted his nights to scavenging and curating only the
              highest quality trash for his fellow night crawling critters. We
              acquire new bads weekly so you can be certain you will always be
              at the forefront of high end Trashion.{" "}
